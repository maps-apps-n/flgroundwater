# An Analysis of Water Quality in Florida, 2001 - 2017


# Description
This project takes a look at the different factors that affect the quality of water in Florida. <Br>
The geographical nature of the states' counties involve sea elements, such as salinity. In estuaries, a salinity exceeding
30 ppt (NOAA Water Quality Parameters) is above the accepted threshold. A number of coastal counties present measurements of barium in quantities up to 184 ug/l, which shows an increasing trend since the 1980s (Andreegg, 1997).
