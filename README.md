# Description

This project used water measurement data from the 67 counties of Florida, to identify areas of concern in quality. This analysis sourced estuary, groundwater, river, canal, lake, and reservoir data from the NWIS and the EPA STORET repository for the years 2001 to 2017. The results identify three clusters of importance in regards to external elements in water: <BR>
A significant and increasing amount of salinity, especially in the counties on the southeast coast. <BR>
A surge in barium in the Treasure Coast counties. <br>
An enteroccocus cluster in the Gulf area due to high salinity. <BR>
